# Music-Genre-Classification
Music Genre Classification is an interesting problem that categorizes the music items automatically.  Music genres are hard to systematically and consistently described due to their inherent subjective nature.  In this paper, we use k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm because it is the beginner friendly for this problem.  The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is used for classification and regression and makes predictions on data points based on the similarity measures.  For this project we need a dataset called GTZAN of audio tracks having similar size and similar frequency range. In this project, we develop a classifier on audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain.
